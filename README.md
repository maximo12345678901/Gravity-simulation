# Introduction

Gravitation simulation is a 2D sandbox environment.

Keystrokes:
* `E` - create new planets
* `R` - reset the environment and remove all planets
* Arrow keys - move around

Sliders:
* Planet size - adjust the size for new planets
* Gavity - adjust the gravity constant, applies to all objects

* You can also drag the planets with your mouse cursor to move them around manually
